  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells and slow the growth of the tumor. Combining bevacizumab with interferon alfa may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving bevacizumab together with interferon alfa to see how well it works compared to giving bevacizumab alone in treating patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.</textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>OBJECTIVES: 
  * Compare the objective response rate and progression-free survival in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma treated with bevacizumab with or without low- or high-dose interferon alfa.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.


  * Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive low-dose interferon alfa (IFN-α) subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-14.
  * Arm II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I.
  * Arm III: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I. Patients also receive high-dose IFN-α SC on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12.
In all arms, treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo restaging at the completion of course 12. Patients with stable disease or a clinical response may continue treatment according to their assigned treatment arm for up to 1 year. Patients with stable disease after 1 year of treatment with bevacizumab and IFN-α (arms I and III) may continue to receive bevacizumab alone (as in arm II) in the absence of disease progression.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.


PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-10 months.

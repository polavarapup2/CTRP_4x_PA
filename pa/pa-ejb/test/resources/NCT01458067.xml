  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a pre-screening period to determine if the subject's tumor has PTEN
      deficiencies.  Subjects then continue into the screening phase for Part 1, 2, or 3, as
      appropriate.  In Part 1, subjects will then receive a single dose of 25 mg.  After analysis
      of 24 hour pharmacokinetic (PK) samples, subjects may receive continuous dosing or receive a
      single modified dose.  In Part 2, subjects will be enrolled and dose escalation will occur
      in a 3+3 design.  Subjects will receive a single dose on Day 1, and then begin continuous
      daily dosing after collection of a 72-hour PK sample.  Additional subjects may be enrolled
      at lower dose levels for assessment of pharmacodynamic response.  Once the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD)/ maximum biologically effective dose (mBED) is determined, 12 subjects will be
      enrolled at that dose level and will have additional PK sampling, as well as urine and bile
      sampling for drug metabolite profiling.  In Part 3, 12 subjects will be enrolled in Stage 1
      of one of three individual tumor-specific cohorts and receive the MTD or mBED, as determined
      in Part 2.  If &gt;=1 of 12 subjects in each cohort has a confirmed response by Response
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, an additional 18 subjects will be enrolled
      in Stage 2.  If not, the cohort will be closed.  All subjects in all parts/cohorts will
      receive daily dosing until withdrawal or unacceptable toxicity.

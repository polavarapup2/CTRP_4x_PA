      The surveillance of influenza virus among children with febrile reparatory complaints
      attending the pediatric clinic in Shantou is an epidemiologic study to identify the type
      (influenza A or B) and the subtype of Influenza A of the isolates from children with febrile
      respiratory complaints who attend the pediatric clinic of the first Affiliated Hospital,
      Shantou University Medical College, Shantou Guangdong, China. Also this study investigates
      the genetic composition of all segments of isolated strains using standard molecular
      techniques and to make available the new strains of influenza viruses isolated from such
      children for the formulation of influenza vaccines. Clinical manifestation of the
      respiratory illness is recorded and single nasopharyngeal swab is obtained from eligible
      children. Viral culture is performed on the nasopharyngeal secretions. If influenza is
      isolated, this is characterized if it belongs to influenza A or B. If the virus is
      characterized as influenza A, further antigenic studies is done to determine subtype of
      influenza. Viral isolates is further studied to determine the genetic composition of the
      virus. Information obtained from the viral isolates is shared with the WHO and the CDC.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To identify the type (Influenza A or B) and the subtype of Influenza A of the isolates
           from children with febrile respiratory complaints who attend the pediatric clinic of
           the First Affiliated Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong,
           China.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To investigate the genetic composition of all segments of isolated strains using
           standard molecular techniques.

        -  To make available the new strains of influenza viruses isolated from such children for
           the formulation of influenza vaccines.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0994 in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors. Patients will be enrolled in one of two stages: a dose-escalation
      stage (Stage I) or the subsequent expansion stage (Stage II). Stage I will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of GDC-0994 administered
      daily. Stage II will gather additional data on safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      the recommended dose of GDC-0994 determined in Stage I.

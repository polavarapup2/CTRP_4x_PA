  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eltrombopag olamine (SB-497115-GR) is an orally bioavailable, small molecule thrombopoietin
      receptor agonist that may be beneficial in medical disorders associated with
      thrombocytopenia.  Eltrombopag has been shown to increase platelet counts in patients with
      thrombocytopenia from various etiologies (Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP], liver
      disease, aplastic anemia and chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia). This study proposes to
      enroll 350 subjects with intermediate-1, intermediate-2 or high risk MDS by IPSS, and
      baseline platelet count of &lt;75 Giga (10^9) per liter (Gi/L).  This is a randomized,
      double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to explore the platelet
      supportive care effects of eltrombopag versus placebo in combination with the standard of
      care hypomethylating agent, azacitidine.  The primary objective of this study is to
      determine the effect of eltrombopag versus placebo on the proportion of subjects who are
      platelet transfusion free during the first 4 cycles of azacitidine therapy. Key secondary
      endpoints include overall survival, disease response, and disease progression.

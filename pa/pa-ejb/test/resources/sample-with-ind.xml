  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate may prevent cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate in preventing cancer in healthy men.</textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>OBJECTIVES: 
Primary
  * Determine the toxic effects of Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate, administered as an orange juice suspension, in healthy male participants.
  * Determine a safe dose range of this drug in these participants.
  * Determine a recommended phase II dose of this drug in these participants.

Secondary
  * Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these participants.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study. Participants are sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 dose level cohorts. One participant in each dose level cohort is randomized to receive placebo.

Participants receive 1 of 4 escalating doses of oral Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate or placebo, as an orange juice suspension, on day 1.

After completion of study treatment, participants are followed periodically for 4 weeks.


PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 participants (5 per dose level cohort) will be accrued for this study.

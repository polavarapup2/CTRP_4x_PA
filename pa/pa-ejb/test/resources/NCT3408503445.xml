        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female aged &gt; 18 years.

          -  Patients with histologically proven clinical stage II and IIa operable breast cancer,
             with clinical tumor diameter of at least 2 cm.

          -  Zubrod (Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group [ECOG]) Performance Status (PS) of 0-1.

          -  No prior treatment by surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy e.g. TAMOXIFEN® or
             RALOXIFEN® for prevention or chemotherapy.

          -  Scheduled to undergo definitive local surgery for breast cancer.

          -  Patients must be willing to undergo two mandatory tumor biopsies (pre and post
             therapy) that are not required for standard care. A sample of tumor tissue removed
             during surgery will also be collected for analysis.

          -  Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medication (intact tablet).

          -  Able to undergo all screening assessments outlined in the protocol after giving
             informed consent.

          -  Adequate organ function (defined by the following parameters):

               1. Serum creatinine &lt; 140 μmol/L or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min.

               2. Serum hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL; absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L; platelets &gt;
                  100 x 109/L.

               3. Serum bilirubin &lt; upper normal limit (UNL).

               4. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ UNL;
                  alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (liver isoenzyme fraction) ≤ UNL; albumin within
                  normal limits.

          -  Documented hormone receptor (ER and progesterone receptor) and HER-2- status.

          -  No known hepatitis B virus (unless due to immunization), hepatitis C virus, human
             immune deficiency virus-I and  II positive status.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation or unwillingness to use adequate method of birth control.

          -  Any other breast cancer types including inflammatory form.

          -  Prior surgery to the breast area or primary axillary dissection.

          -  Prior treatment for breast cancer.

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 30 days preceding the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  Any prior or current cancer, except in situ uterine carcinoma or basocellular
             cutaneous cancer considered as definitively cured.

          -  Any associated medical condition considered incompatible with the study, e.g.
             cardiac, renal, medullar, respiratory or hepatic insufficiency.

          -  Neurological or psychiatric disorders which may influence understanding of study and
             informed consent procedures.

          -  Active or uncontrolled infection.

          -  Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function.

          -  Hypersensitivity to:

               1. ibuprofen or to more than one non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug;

               2. medications belonging to the class of sulfonamides, such as sulfamethazine,
                  sulfamethoxazole, sulfasalazine, nimesulide or celecoxib.
